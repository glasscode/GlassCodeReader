*What is it?*
GlassCodeReader is an Android feed parser to parse content from an RSS feed, and 
display it in a native pane in an Android application, giving a seamless user experience.
Many applications can benefit from pulling content via a feed such as RSS/Atom/JSON, but many of them
simply redirect to a WebView, adding little value to the native application experience. GlassCodeReader solves this problem.

*Pre-requisites*
- Requires Apache Commons 2.0 Jar
